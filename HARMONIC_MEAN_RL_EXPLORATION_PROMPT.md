# Harmonic Mean RL Training: Mathematical Foundations and Research Directions

## Context and Mathematical Foundation

I've been working on implementing GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization) and noticed a fascinating mathematical pattern in recent RL algorithms:

### The Mean Hierarchy in Policy Optimization

1. **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**:
   - Uses **arithmetic mean** of token-level importance ratios
   - Formula: `(1/|y|) * Σ(π_θ(y_t|x,y_<t) / π_θ_old(y_t|x,y_<t))`
   - Problem: Unequal token weights cause instability

2. **GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization)**:
   - Uses **geometric mean** via length normalization
   - Formula: `exp((1/|y|) * Σ log(π_θ(y_t|x,y_<t) / π_θ_old(y_t|x,y_<t)))`
   - Equivalent to: `(π_θ(y|x) / π_θ_old(y|x))^(1/|y|)`
   - Benefit: Stabilizes training by equal token weighting

3. **Missing**: **Harmonic Mean Approach**
   - Formula would be: `|y| / Σ(π_θ_old(y_t|x,y_<t) / π_θ(y_t|x,y_<t))`
   - Properties: Dominated by smallest ratios, robust to outliers

### Key Mathematical Insight

The geometric mean has a beautiful property: it's the **limit of recursively taking arithmetic and harmonic means** of two numbers:
- Start with numbers a, b
- A₁ = (a+b)/2 (arithmetic), H₁ = 2ab/(a+b) (harmonic)  
- A₂ = (A₁+H₁)/2, H₂ = 2A₁H₁/(A₁+H₁)
- lim(n→∞) Aₙ = lim(n→∞) Hₙ = √(ab) (geometric mean)

This suggests these three means form a **natural mathematical progression** for optimization algorithms.

## Research Questions to Explore

### 1. Harmonic Mean Policy Optimization (HMPO)

**Core Idea**: What if we use the harmonic mean of importance ratios?

```python
# Harmonic mean importance ratio
def harmonic_importance_ratio(policy_logprobs, ref_logprobs):
    ratios = torch.exp(policy_logprobs - ref_logprobs)  # π_θ/π_θ_old for each token
    inverse_ratios = 1.0 / ratios
    harmonic_mean = len(ratios) / torch.sum(inverse_ratios)
    return harmonic_mean
```

**Properties**:
- **Conservative**: Dominated by smallest ratios (most "off-policy" tokens)
- **Robust**: Less sensitive to extreme outliers than arithmetic mean
- **Stable**: Should be even more stable than GSPO's geometric mean

**Research Questions**:
- Does HMPO provide better sample efficiency than GSPO?
- How does it handle distribution shift and off-policy corrections?
- What are the convergence guarantees?

### 2. Adaptive Mean Selection

**Idea**: Dynamically choose between arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means based on training dynamics.

```python
def adaptive_mean_ratio(ratios, training_step, stability_metric):
    if stability_metric > threshold_high:
        return arithmetic_mean(ratios)  # Fast progress
    elif stability_metric < threshold_low:
        return harmonic_mean(ratios)    # Conservative/stable
    else:
        return geometric_mean(ratios)   # Balanced
```

### 3. Recursive Mean Iterations (RMI-PO)

**Inspired by the geometric mean limit property**:

```python
def recursive_mean_importance_ratio(ratios, num_iterations=5):
    a = arithmetic_mean(ratios)
    h = harmonic_mean(ratios)
    
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        new_a = (a + h) / 2
        new_h = 2 * a * h / (a + h)
        a, h = new_a, new_h
    
    return a  # Converges to geometric mean, but with controlled approach
```

### 4. Generalized Power Mean Framework

**Mathematical Foundation**: All three means are special cases of the power mean:
- Power mean: `M_p = (1/n * Σx_i^p)^(1/p)`
- p = 1: Arithmetic mean
- p → 0: Geometric mean  
- p = -1: Harmonic mean

**Research Direction**: 
- Can we treat `p` as a learnable parameter?
- How does varying `p` during training affect convergence?
- Can we use different `p` values for different sequence positions?

### 5. Multi-Scale Mean Hierarchies

**Idea**: Apply different means at different granularities:
- **Token level**: Harmonic mean (conservative)
- **Phrase level**: Geometric mean (balanced)
- **Sequence level**: Arithmetic mean (aggressive)

### 6. Connection to Information Theory

**Hypothesis**: Different means correspond to different information-theoretic properties:
- **Arithmetic**: Maximizes expected reward
- **Geometric**: Balances exploration/exploitation
- **Harmonic**: Minimizes worst-case regret

### 7. Harmonic Mean and Risk-Averse RL

**Connection**: Harmonic mean is naturally risk-averse due to outlier sensitivity.

**Applications**:
- Safety-critical language generation
- Robust dialogue systems
- Conservative fine-tuning of large models
