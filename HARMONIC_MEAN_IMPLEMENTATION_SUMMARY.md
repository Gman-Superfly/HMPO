## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation Validated

### Mean Hierarchy Confirmed
- **GRPO**: Arithmetic mean → aggressive, unstable
- **GSPO**: Geometric mean → balanced, stable
- **HMPO**: Harmonic mean → conservative, robust

### AGM Algorithm Connection Proven
The geometric mean emerges naturally from iterating arithmetic ↔ harmonic means:
```python
def agm_iteration(a, h):
    new_a = (a + h) / 2                    # Arithmetic mean
    new_h = 2 * a * h / (a + h)           # Harmonic mean
    return new_a, new_h
# Converges to: √(a₀ * h₀) = geometric mean
```

### Power Mean Unification Working
All three means are special cases of the Power Mean with different risk profiles:
- Negative powers → Conservative (risk-averse)
- Zero power → Balanced (Kelly criterion)
- Positive powers → Aggressive (risk-seeking)
